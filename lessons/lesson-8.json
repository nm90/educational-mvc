Handled relationships between three entities (Comments, Tasks, Users)\n6. Used JOINs to avoid N+1 query problems\n7. Implemented proper validation and error handling\n\nYou followed MVC separation:\n- Model: All database logic in Comment class\n- View: HTML templates display data, forms collect input\n- Controller: Routes parse requests, call models, render views\n\nThis is exactly how you build features in production MVC applications!\n\nNext steps:\n- Try adding a delete comment feature\n- Add edit functionality for comments\n- Add user authentication to track who's commenting\n\nYou now understand MVC architecture in practice!",
