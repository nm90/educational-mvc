It represents your application's data (like User or Task) and contains all the validation and rules for that data.\n\nKey points:\n- Models define data structure\n- Models contain validation rules\n- Models know how to save/load from database\n- Models contain business logic\n\nIn our app, look at backend/models/ to see User.py and Task.py - these are Models.",

Controller calls Model methods (validate, save, load, etc)\n5. Model performs business logic and database operations\n6. Model returns data to Controller\n7. Controller passes data to View\n8. View renders HTML with that data\n9. View sends response back to user\n\nThis separation keeps concerns isolated:\n- Model: knows about data rules\n- Controller: knows how to coordinate\n- View: knows how to display\n\nWhen you open the Developer Panel, you'll see this flow happen in real-time!",
